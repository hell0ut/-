tree traversals:
-inorder(left, root, right)
-preorder(root, left, right)
-postorder(left, right, root)
    complexity
-For a Graph, the complexity of a Depth First Traversal is O(n + m), where n is the number of nodes, and m is the number of edges.
-number of edges in Binary Tree is n-1
The complexity then becomes O(n + n-1), which is O(n).
